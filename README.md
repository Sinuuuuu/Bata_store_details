This report outlines the details of a web scraping project focused on extracting store information for Bata in India.
The project involved overcoming dynamic URL challenges and attempting to scrape data from other websites.

To begin, the project focused on gathering data related to Bata stores in India. 
This required the use of web scraping techniques to extract information from the company's website.
However, the challenge arose when it was discovered that the website used dynamic URLs. 
These types of URLs change depending on the user's interactions with the website, making it difficult to extract data using traditional web scraping methods.

So, I decided to look for the dynamic link and got it from the inspect window of the website. After which the work became pretty simple. I converted the file into a JSON
file which are easy to read. 
This takes me to the final step of storing it in the csv file.
